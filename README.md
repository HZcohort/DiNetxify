# 3D Disease Network Analysis

## Overview

In this study, we developed a novel three-dimensional network approach that integrates and refines existing disease trajectory and comorbidity network analysis methods. This new approach enhances disease association verification by incorporating regularized partial correlations. It also facilitates robust identification and visualization of disease clusters (i.e., groups of depression-associated diseases with high within-group connectivity) through both non-temporal (illustrated by the x-axis and y-axis) and temporal (z-axis) dimensions.
